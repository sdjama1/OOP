The car class is designed to keep the properties of a car. It includes the manufacturer,
the model, year, mileage, engine, transmission, drivetrain, mpg, exterior and interior color,
whether or not its been in an accident, and the price. Some of its methods include: paint which changes the
color of the exterior of the car, repair which replaces and car part with another, reupholster which changes
the interior color of the car, drive which increases the mileage of the car, and modify price which changes 
the price of the car. The seller class also comes with its attirbutes which are the name of the car, the rating of
the seller, and the inventory of the seller. The class implementation is done by the init method and the buy method is used 
to add a car to the sellers inventory, and the sell method is used to remove a car from the sellers inventory.
Creating the virtual database was challenging as copilot did make some mistakes with the indexing that i manually tried to fix,
but despite the debugging and time it took I still couldnt figure it out.
